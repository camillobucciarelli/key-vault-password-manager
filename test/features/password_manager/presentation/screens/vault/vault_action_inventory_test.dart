/// Spec 019 T003 — the inventory of every action the vault offers, pinned
/// before journey 03 is restructured.
///
/// Spec 019 moves folder management out of the records list and into its own
/// surface, and rehomes the sync strip's actions. FR-021 and US3 say that not
/// one action may be *lost* on the way: a move is allowed, a disappearance is
/// not. A widget test cannot say that, because it can only assert about the
/// surfaces it happens to mount — the action that quietly stops being built is
/// exactly the one no test opens.
///
/// So the inventory is taken from the source instead, mechanically: every
/// string literal passed to a "tooltip:" or "label:" parameter under the vault
/// screens. That is a superset of the action labels (it also catches field and
/// settings labels), which is the safe direction to err in — it fails when copy
/// disappears, never when it merely moves between files.
///
/// **When this test fails**: if the string moved to another vault file, the set
/// is unchanged and the test stays green — nothing to do. If the set shrank,
/// an action was dropped; restore it. Only edit the pinned list below when the
/// spec deliberately removes copy, and say which requirement allows it.
/// Constitution VI: copy is preserved verbatim unless a spec changes it.

  // The one string removed since this inventory was taken, and the section

  // FR-006e — `Add subfolder` is retired. A folder is created with
  // `New folder` and given a parent with `Move…`, so there is one way to
  // nest instead of two that could disagree. Nothing else may leave this
  // list without the same kind of note (T049, SC-004).
  // 2026-08-31 supersession (user-directed): the vault header's `⋮` overflow
  // sheet was retired. What it alone carried either moved (Lock vault,
  // Recycle bin, Manage duplicates, Database settings -> Settings
  // destination; connect/link/auto-sync -> the Sync destination's hero,
  // outside this file scan; exports -> Backups & import as 'Export the
  // database' / 'Export the key file') or was already reachable elsewhere
  // (standalone Password generator -> the editor's generator). The removed
  // pins: Android autofill, Auto-sync, Change database (now the Settings
  // 'Close database' pill), Connect/Disconnect Google Drive, Desktop browser
  // extension, Export database backup, Export key file, Google Drive, Link
  // database to Drive, Tools, Vault. Password generator stayed: it is a
  // Settings-destination row now.
