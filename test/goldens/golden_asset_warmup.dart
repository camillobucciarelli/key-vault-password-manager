// Deterministic asset decoding for golden tests.
//
// `Image.asset` resolves its bytes through `instantiateImageCodec`, which
// completes on the *real* event loop. `tester.pumpAndSettle()` only advances
// the fake-async zone, so it can — and does — return before the decode has
// finished. The result is that the first test in a file to mount a given
// asset paints an empty box where the image belongs, while every later test
// paints it, because `PaintingBinding.imageCache` is per-isolate and survives
// between `testWidgets` cases.
//
// `cacheWidth` / `cacheHeight` wrap an `AssetImage` in a `ResizeImage`, whose
// cache key includes the decoded dimensions. Warm every size used by goldens;
// warming only the raw 1024 px asset does not populate those resized entries.
//
// Warming the cache once from `setUpAll` — which runs in real async, outside
// the fake-async zone — makes the decode complete before any test body runs,
// so every case paints the image regardless of its position in the file.
