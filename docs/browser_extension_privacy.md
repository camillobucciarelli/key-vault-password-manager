# KDBX Vault Manager Browser Autofill privacy policy

Last updated: August 2, 2026

This policy applies to the KDBX Vault Manager Browser Autofill extension for
Chrome and Microsoft Edge. The extension requires the KDBX Vault Manager desktop
application and its locally installed Native Messaging host.

## Data processed

- When the user asks KDBX Vault Manager to find or search credentials for the
  current site, the extension processes the active tab origin and page title
  locally for credential matching. It sends them only to the KDBX Vault Manager
  Native Messaging host installed on the same computer. Full URL paths, query
  strings, and fragments are not sent or retained.
- When the user runs a global metadata search, the extension sends the entered
  search query locally through the Native Messaging host. The host processes it
  against local KDBX Vault Manager metadata. The extension and host do not retain
  the query or send it to a remote server.
- The local KDBX Vault Manager app publishes credential metadata needed for
  matching, including entry identifiers, titles, usernames, display services,
  normalized site identifiers, and update timestamps. The Native Messaging host
  can search this local metadata. Passwords are not included in this metadata.
- A username and password are transferred locally from the unlocked KDBX Vault
  Manager app through the Native Messaging host only after the user clicks **Fill
  on this page** for an exact site match. The extension injects those values into
  the selected page once and does not submit the form.
- If the user requests a new site association, local pending-association metadata
  is created for confirmation in the KDBX Vault Manager app. It contains no
  password.

## Storage and retention

The extension uses no browser extension storage and retains no credentials or
search queries. Username and password copies handled by the extension and Native
Messaging host exist only transiently during an explicit fill and are not
retained by either component.

The KDBX Vault Manager desktop app necessarily keeps unlocked vault data,
including decrypted credentials and the reveal bridge's credential map, in
process memory while the vault is unlocked. On vault lock, database change, or
bridge stop, the app stops the reveal bridge and clears its in-memory credential
map. Dart strings are garbage-collected; KDBX Vault Manager does not claim
immediate heap or operating-system memory zeroization.

KDBX Vault Manager credential metadata, bridge state, and pending-association
data remain on the user's computer and are cleared when the vault is locked or
the database is changed. Confirmed or rejected pending associations are also
cleared after processing by the app.

## Data sharing and remote transfer

KDBX Vault Manager Browser Autofill has no analytics, advertising, tracking, or
remote code. The extension and Native Messaging host do not send data to a
developer server or cloud service, and do not sell or share user data. During an
explicit fill, credentials are placed into the active website's form fields; the
website may process them if the user submits the form.

Neither the extension nor the Native Messaging host can access the KDBX Vault
Manager master password, key files, or KDBX database contents. Vault access and
decryption remain inside the unlocked KDBX Vault Manager desktop app.
