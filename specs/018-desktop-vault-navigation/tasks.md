# Tasks: Desktop vault navigation and entry actions

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/018-desktop-vault-navigation/`

**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: REQUIRED. The spec carries verification requirements VR-001…VR-003
and US5 is a pure regression story, so test tasks are first-class here, not
optional.

**Organization**: grouped by user story. Phase 2 is a characterisation phase —
it pins today's behaviour **before** any production file is edited, so a US5
regression is caught by a test that predates the change.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: can run in parallel (different files, no dependency on incomplete work)
- **[Story]**: the user story the task serves (US1…US5)

## Path conventions

Flutter app. Production code under `lib/`, tests mirror it under `test/`,
goldens in `test/goldens/`. All paths below are repo-relative to the worktree
`password-manager-018-desktop-nav`.

---

## Phase 1: Setup

**Purpose**: confirm the toolchain and capture the pre-change baseline that
later golden claims are checked against.

- [x] T001 Verify the pinned toolchain resolves in the worktree: run `fvm flutter --version` and confirm 3.47.1 against `.fvmrc`, then `fvm flutter pub get`
- [x] T002 Record the pre-change baseline: run `fvm flutter analyze` and `fvm flutter test`, and save the passing test count plus `ls test/goldens/*.png | sort` output to a scratch file OUTSIDE `specs/` (that directory is tracked and feeds the Projects #2 sync) so VR-003 can be verified by diff rather than by memory

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (blocking prerequisites)

**Purpose**: pin existing behaviour, then install the single width authority.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: T003–T006 must be green **before** any production file is
edited. T007–T011 must complete before any user story phase begins.

### Characterisation — pin today's behaviour first

- [x] T003 [P] Add mobile navigation characterisation tests in `test/features/password_manager/presentation/screens/vault/vault_navigation_mobile_characterisation_test.dart`: at 390×844, activating a record pushes a full-screen detail, the back affordance returns to the list, and the list is intact afterwards
- [x] T004 Add mobile record-action characterisation tests in the same file: edit, move, attachments and delete each behave as they do today from a pushed detail, asserting the dispatched `VaultBloc` events
- [x] T005 [P] Add a presentation-matrix snapshot test in `test/features/password_manager/presentation/navigation/vault_surface_presentation_baseline_test.dart` asserting `presentationFor` for every `VaultSurface` subtype at widths 390, 599, 600, 703, 704, 940, 941, 994, 995 and 1024 — capturing today's answers, so any change is deliberate
- [x] T006 Run `fvm flutter test` and confirm T003–T005 pass against unmodified production code; a failure here means the characterisation is wrong, not the code

### One width authority

- [x] T007 Add the derived vault layout widths to `lib/core/responsive/breakpoints.dart`: `vaultDetailPane = 704`, `vaultFolderPane = 941`, `vaultGeneratorColumn = 995`, each with its arithmetic as a comment per FR-002a and data-model.md E1
- [x] T008 Add the `VaultLayoutClass` enum and `VaultLayoutClass.fromWidth(double)` to `lib/core/responsive/breakpoints.dart` with the four cases `narrowTabBar` / `narrowRail` / `wide` / `wideWithFolders` per contract C1
- [x] T009 [P] Add `VaultLayoutClass` unit tests in `test/core/responsive/vault_layout_class_test.dart` covering contract C1's boundary table (599/600/703/704/940/941/1024) and guarantees G1.1–G1.3
- [x] T010 Change `presentationFor` in `lib/features/password_manager/presentation/navigation/vault_shell_router.dart` to take `VaultLayoutClass` instead of `double width`, removing its hard-coded `600`; update `VaultShellRouter.open` to resolve the class once and pass it, per contract C2
- [x] T011 Update the call sites and expectations in `test/features/password_manager/presentation/navigation/vault_shell_router_test.dart` and `vault_surface_migration_matrix_test.dart` to the new signature — expectations must not change for any surface except `PasswordGeneratorSurface` (G2.2)

**Checkpoint**: one width authority exists, presentation is unchanged, mobile is pinned.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 — One selection, one detail, at every width (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: one record selection drives exactly one detail surface at every
width, with the selected row visibly highlighted.

**Independent Test**: resize across the full range clicking records; exactly
one detail surface is visible, showing the clicked record, with its row
highlighted.

### Tests for User Story 1

- [x] T012 [P] [US1] Add selection-ownership tests in `test/features/password_manager/presentation/screens/vault/vault_selection_test.dart`: at 704 and 1024 exactly one detail surface exists (G3.1), exactly one row is selected (G3.2, SC-001), and the entries card renders no `_EntryDetailPanel` of its own
- [x] T013 [P] [US1] Add a resize test in the same file: with a record selected, crossing 704 and 941 in both directions keeps the same record selected and produces no second detail surface (G3.5, FR-015, SC-008)
- [x] T014 [P] [US1] Add an origin-parity test in `test/features/password_manager/presentation/screens/vault/vault_detail_origin_test.dart`: opening the same record from the records list, from Health and from duplicates yields the same detail surface with the same actions at 1024 (FR-010, SC-007)

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T015 [US1] Move the selected-record state to `_VaultViewState` in `lib/features/password_manager/presentation/screens/vault/vault_shell.part.dart`: add `String? _selectedEntryId`, a setter that opens/cancels the detail session through `_router`, and compute `VaultLayoutClass` once in the shell's `LayoutBuilder`
- [x] T016 [US1] Delete the inline detail from `lib/features/password_manager/presentation/screens/vault/vault_entries.part.dart`: remove `_selectedEntryId`, the `_selectedEntry` getter, its `didUpdateWidget` clearing logic, the `showInlineDetail` `LayoutBuilder` and the `Row(list | _EntryDetailPanel)` branch (FR-001, FR-001a)
- [x] T017 [US1] Give `_EntriesCard` inbound `selectedEntryId` and `onSelectEntry` parameters and thread them from `_VaultEntriesCardSection` in `vault_shell.part.dart`, per contract C3
- [x] T018 [US1] Replace the `708` literal and the `Breakpoints.tablet` folder gate in `_VaultNavigationLayout._railBody` in `vault_shell.part.dart` with the `VaultLayoutClass` cases; set the rail to a flat 72 and the list column to a fixed 330 per FR-002b
- [x] T019 [US1] Make the detail pane persistent at `wide` and `wideWithFolders` — always present, `_EntryDetailEmptyState` when nothing is selected (FR-002c)
- [x] T020 [P] [US1] Apply the selected-row treatment in `lib/features/password_manager/presentation/screens/vault/vault_entries_details.part.dart` using the `KeyVaultColors` accent roles from `PIXEL_SPEC` §2, plus a non-colour cue (FR-004, FR-004a)
- [x] T021 [US1] Clear the selection when the entry leaves the visible list via search or folder change, and when the destination changes away from Vault (FR-014, data-model.md E2)
- [x] T021a [P] [US1] Add a folder-reachability test at 800 px in `test/features/password_manager/presentation/screens/vault/vault_selection_test.dart`: in the 704–940 band the folder column is absent yet every folder remains reachable through the records list's own folder rows, and opening one changes the current group (FR-002d final clause). **This test is what justifies deferring the rail folder-switcher — without it the deferral is an assumption**
- [x] T021b [P] [US1] Add accessibility assertions for the selected row in `test/features/password_manager/presentation/screens/vault/vault_selection_a11y_test.dart`: the selected row is reachable and activatable by keyboard alone, exposes its selected state to semantics, carries a non-colour cue, keeps a ≥44×44 target and a 2 px focus ring, and the detail pane holds its 300 px minimum at 704 and at 1024 (FR-016, FR-004a, Constitution V)
- [x] T021c [US1] Add an action-parity test in `test/features/password_manager/presentation/screens/vault/vault_detail_origin_test.dart`: the set of record actions offered is identical at 390, 800 and 1024 and from every origin, and at wide widths no record surface is presented as a dialog stacked on another dialog (FR-011, FR-011a, G5.6)

**Checkpoint**: US1 is independently demonstrable — selection and detail agree at every width.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 — Record actions always apply, to the current record (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: every confirmed record action is applied to the record as it is now,
or reported — never silently dropped, never written from a stale snapshot.

**Independent Test**: with a detail open, force a list rebuild, then run each
of the four actions and confirm each takes effect on the current record.

### Tests for User Story 2

- [x] T022 [P] [US2] Add a stale-write regression test in `test/features/password_manager/presentation/screens/vault/vault_entry_actions_test.dart`: two consecutive edits of one record both persist and the second does not revert the first (FR-005, G5.1, SC-003). Confirm it FAILS before T025
- [x] T023 [P] [US2] Add a dropped-action regression test in the same file: after the records list rebuilds (search change, bloc emit), a confirmed Edit / Move / Attachments / Delete still dispatches its event (FR-006, G5.2–G5.4, SC-002). Confirm it FAILS before T026
- [x] T024 [P] [US2] Add a cancel-and-vanish test in the same file: cancelling leaves the vault unchanged with the selection intact (G5.5), and an entry that disappears before confirmation abandons the action and reports it rather than writing (G5.7)

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T025 [US2] Change `_handleEntryAction` in `lib/features/password_manager/presentation/screens/vault/vault_entries.part.dart` to take an entry **id** and re-read the entry from `VaultBloc.state.allEntries` at confirmation time, per contract C5 and data-model.md E3
- [x] T026 [US2] In the same function, capture the `VaultBloc` before the first `await` and guard liveness on the surface context instead of `_EntriesCardState.mounted`, removing the silent-drop path (FR-006)
- [x] T027 [US2] Route both origins — the records list and `_openEntryDetailsSurface` — through the single id-based handler so the two paths cannot drift again (FR-010, D9)
- [x] T028 [US2] Ensure every failure path surfaces a message through the existing `VaultBloc` error channel; no branch may end with neither a change nor a message (FR-006, G5.4)

**Checkpoint**: the two data-integrity defects (D4, D5) are fixed and covered by tests that failed first.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 4 — A deleted record never leaves a dead detail (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: when the shown record disappears, the detail returns to the empty
state and nothing stays selected — under every presentation.

**Independent Test**: open a record's detail on a wide window, delete it, and
confirm the pane returns to the empty state with no highlighted row.

*Sequenced before US3 because US3's "return to the record's detail" builds on
the dismissal path this story installs.*

### Tests for User Story 4

- [x] T029 [P] [US4] Add dismissal tests in `test/features/password_manager/presentation/screens/vault/vault_detail_dismissal_test.dart`: deleting the shown record at 1024 returns the pane to `_EntryDetailEmptyState` with no selection and no exception (FR-008, G4.4, G4.5, SC-004)
- [x] T030 [P] [US4] Add a nested-surface test in the same file: with attachments or a confirmation stacked on the detail, the record vanishing dismisses the whole stack (FR-008 scenario 3, G4.3)

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [x] T031 [US4] Replace the `Navigator.pop` fallback in `_EntryDetailsPage` in `lib/features/password_manager/presentation/screens/vault/vault_entry_detail.part.dart` with completion through `VaultOperationScope.of(context)`, so dismissal is presentation-neutral (FR-007, G4.1, G4.2)
- [x] T032 [US4] Clear `_VaultViewState._selectedEntryId` whenever a detail session finishes, whatever ended it — back, escape, deletion, destination change (FR-003, G4.4, data-model.md E2)

**Checkpoint**: no dismissal path can leave a dead pane.

---

## Phase 6: User Story 3 — Editing keeps the user's place (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: the record being edited stays identifiable and selected, and saving
or cancelling returns to that record's detail.

**Independent Test**: on a wide window open a record, edit and save; repeat and
cancel. The record's detail is shown in both cases.

### Tests for User Story 3

- [x] T033 [P] [US3] Add editor-placement tests in `test/features/password_manager/presentation/screens/vault/vault_editor_placement_test.dart`: at 1024 the editor header shows the record's title and the row stays selected during the edit (FR-009a)
- [x] T034 [P] [US3] Add a return-to-detail test in the same file: saving and cancelling both restore that record's detail to the pane (FR-009, SC-005)
- [x] T035 [P] [US3] Add a generator-placement test in the same file: at 1024 the generator is a column, at 980 it is a sheet, and the records list is never dimmed in either case (FR-002e, G2.3)

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T036 [US3] Pass the edited record's title into the editor header in `lib/features/password_manager/presentation/screens/vault/vault_entry_editor.part.dart` and keep the shell selection alive for the duration of the edit (FR-009a)
- [x] T037 [US3] Restore the record's detail to the pane when the editor session completes or cancels, rather than falling back to the empty state (FR-009)
- [x] T038 [US3] Implement the generator column at ≥ 995 and the sheet fallback below it in `vault_entry_editor.part.dart`, collapsing the folder column — never the records list — when the column opens (FR-002e)
- [x] T039 [US3] Confirm no dimming is applied to the records list while the editor or generator is open; if any opacity treatment exists, remove it (FR-002e, Constitution V)

**Checkpoint**: the main editing loop keeps the user's place.

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 — Mobile navigation is unchanged (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: prove, not assume, that mobile is untouched.

**Independent Test**: the Phase 2 characterisation tests still pass unmodified,
and no 390×844 golden has moved.

- [x] T040 [US5] Re-run the Phase 2 characterisation tests (T003–T005) unmodified and confirm they still pass; any edit needed to make them pass is a US5 regression, not a test fix (FR-012)
- [x] T041 [US5] Verify no mobile golden moved: `git status --porcelain test/goldens/ | grep 390x844` must print nothing (VR-003, SC-006, G6.4)
- [x] T041a [US5] Verify no user-facing string changed: diff the literal strings in the touched `lib/features/password_manager/presentation/screens/vault/*.dart` and `navigation/*.dart` files against their `origin/main` versions and confirm no navigation or record-action string was added, removed or reworded (FR-013, Constitution VI)
- [x] T042 [US5] Diff the golden file list against the Phase 1 baseline and confirm the only changes are the five re-recorded 1024 goldens and the six added ones named in plan.md; investigate anything else before accepting it

**Checkpoint**: mobile is provably unchanged.

---

## Phase 8: Evidence and polish

- [x] T043 [P] Add the three new golden cases to `test/goldens/vault_shell_test.dart` — `vault_wide_record_selected`, `vault_wide_empty_detail`, `vault_wide_editor_in_pane` — at 1024×768 in light and dark (VR-001)
- [x] T044 Regenerate goldens with `fvm flutter test test/goldens --update-goldens` and review every changed file against plan.md's expected list
- [x] T045 Rename `editor_generator_sheet_1024x768_light.png` to `editor_generator_column_1024x768_light.png` and add a sheet case below 995, since at 1024 the generator is now a column and the old name asserts the wrong thing
- [x] T046 [P] Add the widget assertions VR-002 requires for the cases deliberately not covered by pixels — fit-width boundary either side, resize with the editor open, deleted-record dismissal, action after a list rebuild — and state the omitted axes in the test file header
- [x] T047 Grep the vault presentation tree for leftover width logic: no `constraints.maxWidth` or `Breakpoints.` comparison may remain in a presentation-selection position outside `VaultLayoutClass` (FR-002a, contract C1 "Forbidden"). `_VaultLayoutBreakpoints.compactPhone` selects padding, not presentation, and is an allowed exception
- [x] T048 Run `fvm flutter analyze` and confirm it is clean (Constitution IX)
- [x] T049 Run the full `fvm flutter test` and confirm the count is at or above the Phase 1 baseline with no failures
- [x] T050 Run `fvm flutter test test/goldens --test-randomize-ordering-seed=$RANDOM` to confirm golden order-independence, per the repo's testing rule
- [ ] T051 (deferred to manual QA) Walk `specs/018-desktop-vault-navigation/quickstart.md` manually on a resizable desktop window and record the result for the six reproduced defects

---

## Dependencies & execution order

### Phase dependencies

- **Phase 1 Setup**: no dependencies
- **Phase 2 Foundational**: T003–T006 must be green before ANY production edit; T007–T011 block every user story
- **Phase 3 US1**: depends on Phase 2. MVP.
- **Phase 4 US2**: depends on Phase 2 only. **Independent of US1** — the action fixes are layout-agnostic and could ship alone.
- **Phase 5 US4**: depends on Phase 2; benefits from US1's selection ownership (T015)
- **Phase 6 US3**: depends on US4's dismissal path (T031, T032)
- **Phase 7 US5**: depends on all production phases being complete
- **Phase 8**: depends on everything

### Critical ordering

- T006 gates every production edit in the repo.
- T022 and T023 must be observed FAILING before T025 and T026.
- T031 before T037 — the editor's return path uses the neutral dismissal.
- T044 after T043, and both after every production change.

### Parallel opportunities

- T003 and T005 in parallel; T004 follows T003 (same file)
- T012, T013, T014 in parallel
- T022, T023, T024 in parallel
- T029, T030 in parallel
- T033, T034, T035 in parallel
- US1 (Phase 3) and US2 (Phase 4) can be worked in parallel by two people after Phase 2

---

## Implementation strategy

### MVP

Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 (US1). That alone makes the desktop vault
coherent: one selection, one detail, a visible highlight, correct thresholds.

### Highest value first, if time is short

**Phase 4 (US2) is the one to do first if only one phase can land.** It fixes
the two data-integrity defects — a confirmed edit reverting an earlier one, and
a confirmed action silently vanishing — and it depends on nothing in Phase 3.
Every other defect is a navigation annoyance; these two lose the user's data.

### Incremental delivery

1. Phase 1 + 2 → foundation, mobile pinned
2. + Phase 4 (US2) → data integrity restored
3. + Phase 3 (US1) → coherent desktop navigation
4. + Phase 5 (US4) → no dead panes
5. + Phase 6 (US3) → editing keeps its place
6. + Phase 7 + 8 → proof

## Notes

- `[P]` = different files, no dependency on incomplete work
- The net diff should be **negative** in `vault_entries.part.dart` — if that
  file grows, the inline split was not actually removed
- No new BLoC, no new coordinator, no new dependency (Constitution II, VIII)
- Commit per phase; tick each box in the same change that lands its work
