# Design conformance audit — implementation vs. Claude Design project

**Date**: 2026-08-29
**Design source**: project `5151eacb-bbf2-44aa-921c-6a0e2d231d12`, mirrored
byte-identical in `docs/design_handoff_keyvault_restyle/` (verified 2026-08-28).
**Normative documents**: `00 Catalogo & Piano`, the per-journey artboards,
`PIXEL_SPEC.md`, `ICONS.md`, and the DQ-1…DQ-3 decisions recorded in
`specs/018-desktop-vault-navigation/spec.md` §Design decisions.
**Method**: artboard + pixel spec read against the shipped Flutter code; every
finding below cites the file that contradicts the design. Findings marked
*[visual]* still need a screenshot of the running app to confirm or close.

## Summary

The restyle landed as **components** but not as **structure** for journey 03.
`lib/core/widgets/` holds the full design kit (`KvListRow`, `KvHealthDot`,
`KvLetterAvatar`, `KvPillButton`, `KvFieldRow`, `KvBottomSheet`, `KvSlider`,
`KvSwitch`, `KvCheckbox`, `KvTag`) and journeys 04–06 use it faithfully. The
vault **shell** — rail, folder column, list column, mobile header — was never
rebuilt to model 1a; it still renders the pre-restyle "strip + folder tree card"
structure, which is model **1c**, the model that was *not* chosen.

| Journey | State |
| --- | --- |
| 01 Database, 02 Unlock | *[visual]* — components in place, structure not re-checked |
| **03 Vault: list, folders, search** | **Divergent — 14 findings, the bulk of this audit** |
| 04 Entry detail | Conforms to the 04-06 artboard; 2 findings |
| 05 Editor, 06 Generator | Conforms; *[visual]* pass owed |
| 07–09 Sync, health, import | *[visual]* — screens exist, not pixel-checked |
| 10–12 Security, autofill, extension | *[visual]* — screens exist, not pixel-checked |
| 13 Icon family | 1 finding (in-app mark) |
| 14 Dark mode | *[visual]* |
| Shell chrome (cross-journey) | 3 findings, one of them a visible defect |

---

## A. Shell chrome — cross-journey

### C-SH-01 · Two back buttons whenever a pushed surface is open · **defect**

`_VaultPaneHost` (`vault_shell.part.dart:1173`) unconditionally renders its own
`IconButton` above every pushed pane. The pane it hosts — `_EntryDetailsPage` —
draws its *own* back chevron whenever `allowsPop` is true, which spec 018 made
`!layout.hasDetailPane`, i.e. exactly the band where `_VaultPaneHost` is used.
Both are therefore always on screen together below 704 px. Reported by the user
with a screenshot at ~670 px; also visible after resizing a window down with a
record open.

**Design**: one back affordance, a 36 px circle icon button in the screen
header (`PIXEL_SPEC` §2 Buttons, §4 Entry detail).

### C-SH-02 · The host back button is unstyled

The same `IconButton` is a bare Material button: no 36 px circle, no
`neutral-100`/`neutral-200` fill, no 44 px hit area. `PIXEL_SPEC` §2 requires a
36 × 36 circle with a 17–19 px glyph inside a 44 px target. Closing C-SH-01 by
deleting the host chrome closes this too.

### C-SH-03 · Rail mark is a glyph, not the app mark

**Resolved by spec 019** — T051 — the rail renders `keyvault-mark-monochrome.svg` at 38 × 38 / r13; `key-round` no longer appears in the chrome (`vault_chrome_test.dart`).

`_VaultRail` (`vault_shell.part.dart:1140`) draws `AppGlyph.key` inside a
38 × 38 / r13 tile. `ICONS.md` §1 "In-app usage of the mark" requires the
**Combinatore mark** itself at 38 × 38 / r13 in the tablet rail (and 40/14 in the
database list header, 88/26 on Welcome, 76/24 on the lock overlay). The mark
ships already (`specs/_design/keyvault-mark.svg`, spec 007A raster set).

---

## B. Journey 03 — Vault: list, folders, search

> **Status: closed by spec 019.** Every finding in section B, plus `C-SH-03`,
> is marked resolved below with the task that closed it. Two findings were
> re-stated rather than closed as written — see the note under `C-03-06`, whose
> original wording claimed the sort itself was missing when only its control
> was, and `C-03-02`, whose chip row turned out to be needed at 704–940 as well
> as on the phone. `C-SH-01` and `C-SH-02` were closed earlier, by spec 018.

The adopted model is **1a** (spec 002's own title; re-confirmed as DQ-1 in spec
018). None of the structure below is a matter of taste: 1a is what the repo
chose and what every later artboard assumes.

### Mobile (390 × 844)

### C-03-01 · No screen header

**Resolved by spec 019** — T035 — `_VaultListHeader`: `Vault`, `<n> items · <database>.kdbx`, then the database actions, the sort affordance and the add affordance, each in a 44 px target.

**Design**: `Vault` (Caprasimo 28–30) with `128 items · Personal.kdbx` beneath,
a filter icon button and an `accent-300` add button on the right.
**Implemented**: the pre-restyle `_SyncStatusStrip` card — a database name, a
sync icon and an overflow menu inside a `Card`
(`vault_navigation.part.dart:3`). This is model 1c's status strip, which 1a
replaces with the header plus the Sync tab.

### C-03-02 · No folder filter chips

**Resolved by spec 019** — T036 — `_VaultFolderChipRow` with `KvFilterChip`: `Folders`, `All`, then first-level folders only. It also stands in for the folder column in the 704–940 band.

**Design**: a horizontal chip row `All · Work · Banking · Social · Devs` under
the search field, folders acting as a filter.
**Implemented**: no chip row anywhere; folders are rows inside the list tree.
No `ChoiceChip`/`FilterChip` exists in `lib/`.

### C-03-03 · The list is a folder tree, not a flat record list

**Resolved by spec 019** — T026 — `_buildEntriesList` renders `state.visibleEntries` and nothing else. `_EntryTreeNode`, the grouping walk and `_FolderListItem` are deleted.

**Design**: a flat list of records; folders never appear as rows.
**Implemented**: `_EntriesCard._buildEntriesList`
(`vault_entries.part.dart:319`) builds `_EntryTreeNode`s — folder rows with
expand chevrons, per-folder `•••` menus and nested indentation. This is the
single largest structural divergence and it is what the user's screenshots
show on both mobile and desktop.

### C-03-04 · Row trailing is an overflow menu, not one-tap copy

**Resolved by spec 019** — T039 — a 44 px `Copy password` button on every row, through the same `ClipboardGuard` and with the same confirmation string as the detail.

**Design**: health dot, then a 36 px **copy** button — "copia a un tocco dalla
lista" is principle 2 of the catalogue.
**Implemented**: health dot, then `PopupMenuButton` "Record actions"
(`vault_entries_details.part.dart:290`). Everything else in the row (38 avatar,
title 15/600, subtitle 12.5, 62 min-height, `accent-200` selected state) already
matches `PIXEL_SPEC` §2.

### C-03-05 · Search placeholder and count

**Resolved by spec 019** — T029 — the placeholder reads `Search <n> items`.

**Design**: `Search 128 items` — the count is in the placeholder, and repeated
as `128 items` above the list.
**Implemented**: `Search records and folders`, no count anywhere. (The string
matches the *04-06* artboard, which DQ-1 ruled is the editor's working context,
not the shell.)

### C-03-06 · The sort control is missing — the sort itself is not

**Resolved by spec 019** — T028 / T038 — the control exists at last: a menu beside the count line on desktop, a `Sort` sheet on the phone. The three `VaultEntrySort` values and the ordering itself are untouched.

**Design**: `Username ↑` at the right of the count row; the catalogue lists
`Ordinamento (title ↑↓, username)` as an existing journey-03 state.
**Implemented**: the sort is fully built and **orphaned**. `VaultEntrySort`
(`titleAsc`, `titleDesc`, `usernameAsc`), `VaultState.sortBy` defaulting to
`usernameAsc` — which is exactly what the artboard draws — the `SetVaultSort`
event and the comparator in `VaultBloc` all exist. Nothing in `lib/` dispatches
`SetVaultSort`, so the user can never leave the default. This is a missing
control, not missing behaviour.

### Tablet / desktop (1024 × 768)

### C-03-07 · Folder column has no database identity

**Resolved by spec 019** — T023 — the column is titled with `path.basename(databasePath)`.

**Design**: `Personal.kdbx` as the column title, Caprasimo.
**Implemented**: the literal string `'Folders'`
(`vault_shell.part.dart:1215`).

### C-03-08 · Folder column has no "All items" row

**Resolved by spec 019** — T023 — `All items` is the first row, selected by default, and it IS the root group (FR-002a).

**Design**: `All items 128` is the first row and the default selection.
**Implemented**: only the raw group list; the root has no row of its own.

### C-03-09 · Folder column has no counts

**Resolved by spec 019** — T007 / T023 — counts from one post-order walk, inclusive of descendants.

**Design**: every row carries its record count (`Work 41`, `Banking 12`, …).
**Implemented**: `ListTile(title: Text(group.name))` — name only.

### C-03-10 · Folder column has no hygiene shortcuts

**Resolved by spec 019** — T024 — `Recycle bin` and `Duplicates` at the foot of the column, with their counts.

**Design**: `Recycle bin 3` and `Duplicates 4` pinned at the bottom of the
column.
**Implemented**: both are reachable only from the strip's overflow menu.

### C-03-11 · Folder column uses raw `ListTile`s

**Resolved by spec 019** — T025 — `_VaultFolderPane` and its raw `ListTile`s are gone; the column is `KvFolderTree`.

The column is a `ListView` of Material `ListTile`s, so it inherits Material's
metrics and selection colours instead of `KvListRow` / `PIXEL_SPEC` §2 (radius
22, padding 13/16, `accent-200` selected).

### C-03-12 · The list column shows the mobile status strip

**Resolved by spec 019** — T031 — `_VaultSyncStatusStrip` no longer sits above the records list, and `_SyncStatusStrip` itself is deleted. Its actions moved to `_VaultDatabaseActions` (T044).

At every width the vault pane is `strip card + entries card`. The design's
tablet list column is `search · count · sort · rows` with the database identity
living in the folder column instead.

### C-03-13 · Rail and tab bar destination glyphs

**Resolved by spec 019** — T052 — Vault is `lock`, Sync is `refresh-cw`, per `ICONS.md` and DQ-4.

Resolved by the design source on 2026-08-29 (DQ-4 below): `ICONS.md` is
normative for glyph identity.

- **Vault**: must be `lock`. Implemented as `AppGlyph.folder`
  (`vault_shell.part.dart:891`). `folder` stays mapped to Groups — the folders
  are the groups, not the vault, so there is no collision.
- **Sync**: must be `refresh-cw`. Implemented as `AppGlyph.cloud`.
- **Settings**: `settings` (gear). The code is already right; the sun drawn in
  the `03` artboards is an error, not a variant — `sun` is already the theme
  selector, so using it for Settings collides inside one set.

The vendored assets are the real Lucide paths at stroke 2.75
(`assets/icons/lucide/`), so nothing is owed on the asset side.

### C-03-14 · Selected rail destination has no fill

**Resolved by spec 019** — T053 — the selected destination carries an `accent-200` tile in both the rail and the tab bar, in addition to the `Semantics(selected:)` it already had.

**Design**: the active destination sits on an `accent-200` rounded tile (the
user's screenshot of the design shows the peach tile under the Vault icon).
**Implemented**: colour change only (`colors.linkText`).

## C. Journey 04 — Entry detail

Structurally conformant: header avatar/title/subtitle, 36 px circle actions,
field rows, strength strip, TOTP row and reveal countdown all exist as designed
(`vault_entry_detail.part.dart`, `widgets/entry/*`).

### C-04-01 · Empty state copy is undesigned *[visual]*

**Resolved** — the detail's empty state now uses the design's empty-state
recipe: a 74 px feature circle, a Caprasimo title and 13.5 body, matching the
recycle bin's. The copy itself is unchanged.



`No item selected` / `Select a record from the list to view all details and copy
fields.` (`vault_entries_details.part.dart:511`) has no artboard. The design's
empty states elsewhere use a feature circle + Caprasimo title + 13.5 body.

### C-04-02 · Action row position — **closed, code is right**

Confirmed by the design source (DQ-5): the actions belong at the top, per the
04-06 artboard. The bottom row in `03`'s 1a panel is a single exception that
`03` already contradicts itself on — its own 1c model puts the same three
actions at the top — it mixes registers (a credential action beside object
management and a counter), and `margin-top:auto` does not survive a persistent
column that scrolls.

### C-04-03 · The action row is missing `Open <host>`

**Resolved** — `Open <host>` is offered when the record has a URL and omitted
when it does not, with the host as the label rather than the whole URL. It
takes its own row beneath the two copy actions: three pills sharing a 330 px
column wrapped `mail.google.com` mid-word. A record that stores a bare domain
(the common case — users type `github.com`, not the scheme) is opened as
`https://`, and a failure to open is reported rather than swallowed.



**Normative inventory**: `Copy password` (primary) · `Copy username` ·
`Open <host>`, the last omitted when the record has no URL.
**Implemented**: `Copy password` and `Copy username` only
(`vault_entry_detail.part.dart:413`).

### C-04-04 · `Attachments` is in the overflow menu as well as a section

**Resolved by spec 020 (2026-08-31)** — the section is permanent with its count and a `Manage` action, the overflow item is gone, spec 018 FR-011 amended in writing. History of the first attempt, kept for the reasoning: removing the menu item
was tried and backed out for two reasons, both found by the tests:

1. The body chip renders only when the record **already has** an attachment, so
   the menu item is currently the only way to add the first one. Removing it
   creates a dead end. Closing the finding properly means making the section
   permanent with its count — a journey-04 change, not a deletion.
2. Spec 018's mobile characterisation pins the item at every width (FR-011).
   That guarantee can be re-negotiated, but in the open and in the spec that
   owns it, not silently.

Left to spec 020, with the shape of the fix now known.



**Normative**: attachments are a section with a count and a `Manage` action;
the header overflow carries object management only.
**Implemented**: `_EntryAction.attachments` is a menu item
(`vault_entry_detail.part.dart:527`) *and* reachable from the body row, so the
same affordance exists twice.

### C-04-05 · No `Duplicate` record action — **implemented on request**

**Resolved** — the product decision was taken on 2026-08-29: `Duplicate` is
offered from the record row's menu and from the detail's overflow. It is a new
capability, so it is recorded here rather than folded silently into spec 019's
"no new capability" boundary (FR-020). Covered by
`vault_duplicate_entry_test.dart` and `vault_entry_detail_actions_test.dart`.

The copy is made inside `VaultKdbxService.duplicateEntry`, not through
`CreateVaultEntry`: a record carries protected strings, custom fields (where
the TOTP secret lives) and attachment bytes that exist only inside the
database, and none of those can travel back in through the editor's field
list. Original text of the finding follows.



The normative overflow inventory is `Move / Delete / Duplicate`. Duplicating a
record does not exist anywhere in the app: no `_EntryAction`, no `VaultEvent`,
no service call. Adding it is a **new feature**, which the catalogue's own
assumption forbids ("Zero funzionalità nuove inventate"). Recorded here and not
implemented; it needs a product decision, not a conformance fix.

## D. Journeys not yet pixel-audited

01, 02, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 14 have their screens implemented and
use the design kit. A full page-by-page pass needs the running app: the audit
above is code-verified, and guessing at pixels from source is how the first
round of drift happened. Screenshots of each screen (light + dark, phone +
desktop) close them.

---

## Proposed remediation

| Spec | Scope | Why separate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **019** | Journey 03 to model 1a + shell chrome (C-SH-01…03, C-03-01…14) | One structural change: the vault shell. Carries the visible defect. |
| **020** | Pixel pass on journeys 01–02 and 04–06, **plus C-04-04** | Drafted at `specs/020-journey-01-06-pixel-pass/`. C-04-04 is specifiable today; the rest needs the visual pass |
| **021** | Pixel pass on journeys 07–09 | Drafted at `specs/021-journey-07-09-pixel-pass/`, blocked on screenshots |
| **022** | Pixel pass on journeys 10–12 and dark mode | Drafted at `specs/022-journey-10-12-dark-mode/`, blocked on screenshots |

All three drafts carry **no `tasks.md`** on purpose: a spec without one shows as
`Todo` on the board with its body as the explanation, which is the honest state
for work whose scope is not yet knowable.

Spec 019 depends on spec 018's `VaultLayoutClass`, so it stacks on that branch.

## Design decisions taken during this audit

Answered by the design source on 2026-08-29. Normative from here on.

- **DQ-4 — glyph identity**: DQ-1's split applies by *axis*, not by file. The
  artboards are normative for **layout and geometry**; the written documents are
  normative for **glyph identity and mapping**. So `ICONS.md` wins on which
  glyph a slot uses. Consequences in C-03-13. The artboards themselves are owed
  three corrections (below).
- **DQ-5 — detail action row**: top, per 04-06. Full normative inventory for
  the detail panel: header with avatar + title + `Edit`; action row
  `Copy password` / `Copy username` / `Open <host>`; fields; `Attachments` as a
  section with its count; `Move` / `Delete` / `Duplicate` in the header's
  `more-vertical` overflow.

### Owed in the design project *(not this repo's work)*

Carried forward from spec 018's list, plus what DQ-4 adds:

- `03`: rail `76 → 72`; Settings glyph sun → `settings` in the tab bar (line 81)
  and the rail (line 94); Vault glyph redrawn from the real Lucide `lock`.
- `04-06`: list `352 → 330` in both artboards; remove `opacity:.5` from the list
  in "Editor con generatore aperto".
- Add a drawn artboard for the 704–940 folder-collapsed band.
- The hand-drawn glyph paths across the artboards (`lock`, `refresh-cw`,
  `shield-check`) are approximations, not Lucide. Under "do not mix sets" a
  redrawn padlock is effectively a third set. The real Lucide path at stroke
  2.75 is normative and the artboards follow it, not the other way round. The
  repo's vendored assets are already correct.

### Applied in this repo on 2026-08-29

- `ICONS.md` (both copies): added `— (new) | lock | Vault tab, vault slot of
  the rail`.
- `PIXEL_SPEC.md` (both copies): "Tablet columns" rewritten to the single
  values `72` / `330`, with the generator column and the derived thresholds —
  the correction spec 018 owed.
