# Implementation Plan: Entry detail — one home for attachments

**Branch**: `feat/020-attachments-section` | **Date**: 2026-08-31 | **Spec**: `spec.md`

## Summary

Turn the conditional `More` block of the entry detail into a permanent
`Attachments` section (count, `Manage`), drop the `Attachments` item from the
detail header overflow, amend spec 018 FR-011 in writing, update the tests that
pinned the old menu, re-record the five entry-detail goldens.

## Technical Context

Flutter 3.47.1 (`.fvmrc`), Dart. UI only — no BLoC, use case, repository or
KDBX change. `Manage` dispatches the existing `_EntryAction.attachments`, which
`vault_entries.part.dart` already routes to `_showAttachmentsDialog`. Tests:
`flutter_test` widget tests + goldens.

## Constitution Check

| Principle | Status |
|---|---|
| I secrets | untouched |
| II layering | untouched — presentation only |
| III tokens | section uses `AppTextStyles.labelUpper`, `KeyVaultColors`, existing pill; no hex |
| IV pixel fidelity | goldens named in SC-003; 1024 dark for entry detail was never recorded — pre-existing gap, not widened |
| V a11y | `Manage` reuses an existing ≥ 44 px pill; count is text, not colour |
| VI copy | changes named in FR-007 |
| VIII smallest thing | no new widget file; reuse `_MoreChip` (rename to `_ManagePill` only if it helps) or an existing pill |
| IX verify locally | tasks T008 |

No violations → no Complexity Tracking. No research.md / data-model.md /
contracts: no unknowns, no entities, no external interface.

```

**Structure Decision**: single part file changes; tests mirror it.

## Design

- Section = label row `ATTACHMENTS` (`labelUpper`, `textSecondary`) with the
  count beside it, then a `Manage` pill → `onSelectedAction(_EntryAction.attachments)`.
  Replaces the `if (entry.attachments.isNotEmpty) … 'More' … _MoreChip` block.
- Header overflow: delete the `_EntryAction.attachments` item and the spec-019
  comment above it. Enum value stays (list-row menu still uses it).
- FR-011 test edits follow the amended inventory: overflow = `Move`, `Delete`
  (+ `Duplicate`, `Record info`); section = `Attachments` + `Manage`.
