// spec-008 T302/T302a/T303 — the data-owned implementation of the frozen merge
// port.
//
// **The whole point of this file is that it is the only thing that knows.** The
// domain port speaks in opaque ids, redacted decisions and safe codes; every
// fact those stand for — the canonical path, the master password, the key-file
// bytes, the two `KdbxFile`s, the object UUIDs, the field keys, the decrypted
// values and the attachment bytes — lives here, in `_MergeSession`, and is
// dropped when the session is cancelled, invalidated or completed.
//
// **T401 — FR-7's write-verify-converge cycle.** `commit` now writes: it
// revalidates under the shared `DatabasePathMutex`, replaces the local file
// through `SafeVaultFileWriter` (T108/T109's collision-safe backup + atomic
// replace, reused as-is), uploads through `GoogleDriveApiService` and treats
// the upload's own follow-up `getFileMetadata` fetch as the mandatory step-5
// read-back — a real second round trip the server answers strictly after the
// write completes, not a cached echo of what we sent. On divergence it
// re-anchors to the observed remote content, short-circuits on canonical
// semantic-manifest equality, and otherwise re-merges with the T401b sticky
// decision ledger, up to a budget of 3 rounds per `commit` call.
//
// **T403/T404 — the atomic commit.** Every round of the cycle composes, in
// this order and nowhere else: candidate semantic revalidation, verified
// collision-safe backup, same-directory temp + atomic replace, the
// pre-dispatch `PendingMergeUpload` record, the upload, the step-5 read-back
// and only then the mapping finalization. A backup failure aborts before any
// remote write; a mapping is never finalized on an unverified response.
//
// **T407/T408 — restart recovery.** `recoverPending` reads the persisted
// record under the same mutex, guards on the local checksum BEFORE any remote
// call, then triages the remote checksum: applied → finalize; unchanged
// expected-old → re-put the committed local bytes and verify; anything else →
// hand off to a new conflict, retaining the local merge and its backup.
// No concurrency token is selected or sent: Drive declares no `conditionalWrite`
// capability, so FR-7's optional token never applies to this adapter.
