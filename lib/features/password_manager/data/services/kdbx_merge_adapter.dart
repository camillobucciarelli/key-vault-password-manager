// spec-008 T301/T304/T305/T306/T308/T309 — the production KDBX <-> merge-model
// adapter.
//
// **What this file is.** The data-layer bridge that reads two `.kdbx` sides,
// produces the evidence a per-field and per-record diff is computed from, and
// — since slice 2 — applies the resolved decisions and serializes the merge
// candidate. It is the promotion of the Gate 0 spike helpers (`_validateSide`,
// `_crossSideKindMismatch`, `_lineageMatches` in `vault_kdbx_service_test.dart`)
// from test-only code into production code, with the typed refusals the frozen
// domain contract defines.
//
// **What this file is NOT, and why.**
//
//   * It **never touches the filesystem**. The caller hands over bytes and gets
//     bytes back. There is therefore no `withDatabaseLock` and no
//     `SafeVaultFileWriter` call here, and Gate 1's writer-routing guard has
//     nothing to route — building a candidate in memory is not a write, which
//     is a stronger statement than "it takes the mutex". The merge commit that
//     does write the candidate to disk (T403) is a separate, later task and
//     routes through both.
//   * It does **not** call `KdbxFile.merge`. That method is marked unfinished
//     upstream and is forbidden by the spec; a source scan in
//     `vault_kdbx_service_test.dart` enforces it over this file too. The record
//     import below is written against `cloneInto`/`forceSetUuid` instead, which
//     is what the Gate 0 T003 spike proved.
//
// **Secret boundary (T303).** `Credentials`, `KdbxFile`, decrypted string
// values and attachment bytes are legitimate in `data/` and illegitimate
// anywhere else. Nothing in this file is reachable from `domain/` or
// `presentation/` — enforced by `sync_merge_domain_architecture_test.dart`. The
// diff model below deliberately carries an attachment's **digest and length**,
// never its bytes: the diff only needs to classify, and a model that carried
// plaintext would be one refactor away from a log line.
