// 009 Slice A2 — durable opt-in, dynamic registration, crash-consistent revoke.
//
// This file is PRODUCTION code. `background.js` loads it with
// `importScripts("overlay_security.js", "overlay_lifecycle.js")` and the Node
// harness under `test/` loads the very same file through `require()` against a
// fake browser. There is one implementation of every rule below.
//
// Every validation rule this file needs already exists in `overlay_security.js`
// (SR-2 canonical origin, the broad permission set, `overlayConfigV2` shape,
// focus-grant store). Nothing is re-implemented here: this file owns
// only the *lifecycle* — when the durable value is written, in which order the
// revocation side effects run, and how a cold worker reconciles browser state
// back to the committed config.
//
// No `chrome.*` global is referenced. The browser API arrives as one injected
// object so the crash-injection harness can drive it deterministically.

"use strict";

// MV3 `importScripts` shares one global scope across worker files: every
// top-level binding lives inside this IIFE so it cannot collide with
// `overlay_security.js` / `overlay_routes.js` (`require()` in the Node harness
// would never show the collision). See `test/worker_global_scope.test.js`.

// A017 — popup control state.
//
// Pure so the popup renders a state it did not compute itself. `denied` is not
// derivable from durable state: it is the transient answer to one declined
// `permissions.request`, so the popup passes it in.
//
// SLICE C — the switch is GLOBAL, so the state is derived from the config, not
// from the tab. `tabUrl` survives for exactly one purpose: when the switch is
// OFF and the current page is not an http(s) page, "unsupported" is the honest
// answer (turning the overlay on would visibly do nothing here).
//
// ORDER MATTERS AND IS A SAFETY PROPERTY: `enabled` is reported BEFORE the
// `unsupported` check, so a user sitting on a `chrome://` page is still shown
// the switch in its on state with a working "Turn off". A UI that hid the off
// switch on non-http(s) pages would be a permission the user cannot withdraw
// from where they are standing.
//
// WHY `reconciling` IS KEPT, and its exact reachability today.
//
// REACHABILITY: this branch is currently reachable ONLY from tests. The single
// production caller, `siteState`, awaits `ready()` and then calls this without
// passing `ready`, so the default `true` always wins. `test/
// overlay_lifecycle.test.js` is the only site that passes `ready: false`.
// Stated here so nobody deletes it believing it dead, and nobody reads it as
// evidence that the popup renders this state today. It does not.
//
// WHY IT STAYS ANYWAY: it is the correct answer for a window that genuinely
// exists, and the alternative is not "no state" but a WRONG state. Without it
// a popup opened while reconciliation is in flight would fall through to
// `disabled` and render "Off / Turn on". A user clicking that would fire
// `permissions.request` while a reconcile is still running — reopening exactly
// the grant/sweep race A2-M15 pins, this time from the UI side, where the
// worker's `prunePermissions: false` deferral cannot help because the reconcile
// is already in flight and never saw the grant.
//
// So the branch is retained deliberately: the moment `siteState` (or any future
// caller) reports readiness honestly instead of awaiting it, this is the state
// that must be rendered, and the popup already handles it as a no-action row.

   * renamed with it the v2 config would have restarted at revision 1 while
   * focus grants minted at a higher v1 revision were still in flight.
   *
   * CLOSES the "KNOWN GAP" Slice A2 left here. In A2 a total corruption of
   * the config (an unreadable revision, `null`, a missing key, a
   * negative revision) salvaged 0 and the next commit restarted the counter at

   *   config whose revision is BELOW it is treated as corrupt — that is what a
   *   rollback to an older-but-well-formed value looks like.
   *
   *   CONTAINMENT — `_readConfig` clears every in-memory grant the moment it
   *   observes an invalid config, and the authorization paths refuse to serve
   *   until reconciliation has rebuilt a valid value. This holds even if the

  /**
   * macOS grant race — consume the popup's pending enable intent.
   *
   * Called by the `permissions.onAdded` listener AFTER its
   * `reconcile({ prunePermissions: false })`. On macOS the permission prompt
   * closes the popup, so the popup's own `setSiteState enable` never arrives;
   * this path finishes the enable from the intent the popup wrote to
   * `storage.session` under the user gesture, before the request.
   *
   * Security invariants, in order:
   *   - ONE-SHOT: the intent is deleted before any use, like the focus-grant
   *     tokens. A delete that fails aborts — acting on an unburned intent is
   *     a replay.
   *   - FAIL-CLOSED SHAPE: garbage is deleted and ignored
   *     (`validateEnableIntent`, exact keys, canonical origin).
   *   - TTL: an intent older than `ENABLE_INTENT_TTL_MS` (or from the future)
   *     is only deleted, never acted on.
   *   - GRANT SUFFICIENCY: the event must carry the WHOLE broad pair. Slice A2
   *     compared the granted pattern against the origin named in the intent;
   *     under one global switch there is no origin to compare, so the check
   *     that survives is that the grant the user just accepted actually covers
   *     what this switch means. A narrower grant — including a per-origin
   *     pattern granted for some unrelated reason — enables nothing.
   *   - The enable goes through the same `enable` (permission re-check, single
   *     commit, registration) as the popup path. No new path. It is
   *     idempotent, so popup-survives platforms where both complete still
   *     produce one coherent outcome.
   *
   * No intent stored → `no_intent`, behaviour identical to before this fix.
