# Privacy Policy

**Application:** KeyVault Password Manager
**Data controller:** Camillo Bucciarelli
**Contact:** bucciarelli.camillo92@gmail.com
**Last updated:** 2026-08-15

## Summary

This application collects nothing. There is no account, no telemetry, no
analytics, no crash reporting, and no advertising. The developer operates no
server and receives no data from your device, ever.

## Data stored on your device

| Data | Where | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Vault contents (entries, passwords, notes, TOTP secrets) | Encrypted `.kdbx` file in a location you choose | The core function of the application |
| Master password, **only if you enable biometric unlock** for a database | Platform keystore (Apple Keychain, Android Keystore, OS secure store on desktop) | Serving a biometric unlock of that database. It is never written to the keystore when biometric unlock is off — in that case it lives only in memory while the vault is open. When stored, it is keyed per database and removed the moment you disable biometric unlock or delete that database. |
| Google OAuth tokens, only if you enable cloud sync | Platform keystore | Authenticating to your own cloud storage |
| Preferences (theme, selected database path) | Application preferences storage | Restoring your settings |

This data never leaves your device except through the cloud sync you explicitly
enable, described below. It is not accessible to the developer.

## Optional cloud sync

Cloud sync is off by default. If you enable it:

- You authenticate directly with Google. The developer never sees your Google
  credentials.
- Only the **encrypted** `.kdbx` file is uploaded. Your master password is never
  uploaded, and the file cannot be decrypted without it. Google, and anyone who
  obtains the file, sees ciphertext.
- The file is stored in **your own** Google Drive, under your own account and
  your agreement with Google. The developer has no access to it.
- Google's handling of that data is governed by the Google Privacy Policy:
  https://policies.google.com/privacy

Disabling sync stops all uploads. Deleting the file from your Google Drive
removes the cloud copy; the developer cannot do this for you because the
developer has no access.

## Autofill

The autofill integrations (Android autofill service, Apple credential provider,
desktop browser extension with native messaging host) run locally on your
device. Credentials are passed from the vault to the requesting application or
browser through operating system channels. Nothing is sent over the network, and
no record of autofill usage is transmitted anywhere.

## Network connections

The application connects only to:

- `accounts.google.com` and `oauth2.googleapis.com` — sign-in, only when you
  enable cloud sync
- `www.googleapis.com` — Google Drive upload and download, only when you enable
  cloud sync
- `127.0.0.1` on a local port — detecting the desktop native messaging host for
  browser autofill. This connection never leaves your computer.

Opening the browser extension page or the native host download uses links
handed to your system browser; the application itself makes no request to those
sites.

No connection is made to any server operated by the developer, because none
exists.

## Third parties

There are no analytics providers, advertising networks, or data processors. No
data is sold, shared, or disclosed, because none is collected. The only third
party involved is Google, and only for the cloud sync you choose to enable,
under your own account.

## Your rights

Because no personal data is collected or processed by the developer, there is
no data to access, correct, export, or erase on the developer's side. All your
data is under your direct control:

- **Export:** your vault is a standard `.kdbx` file, readable by KeePass and
  compatible clients.
- **Erase:** delete the `.kdbx` file and uninstall the application. Uninstalling
  removes the keystore entries. Delete any cloud copy from your own Drive.

Under the GDPR the developer acts as a data controller with no processing
activity. Enquiries may be sent to the contact address above.

## Children

The application is not directed at children under 13 and collects no data from
any user regardless of age.

## Changes

Changes to this policy are published in this file in the public repository, with
the "Last updated" date revised. The Git history is the authoritative record of
every revision.
